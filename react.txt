* 3. What is Event?
  Event is an object which is only triggers when somethings special happens and return an object to the listener which contain information related to that event.

  Ex: Button click, Input Element, Form Submission etc.

! Note: Event is only way to interact with users and get users feedback.

? Every Event has -
    - Name
    - listener Function
    
! There are four main method to style react app

1. Inline CSS 
2. CSS Class
3. CSS Module (Better way to style component)
4. CSS (Styled Component)

! What is CSS Module?
In simpler terms, CSS Modules allows us to use the same class name in multiple files without clashes since each class name is given a unique programmatic name. This is especially useful in larger applications. Every class name is scoped locally to the specific component in which it is being imported.
